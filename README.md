**Project Information:**
---------------

### Ideation

Purpose:
Playground / Interface for gaming: similar to cool math games or frivv. We wanted the user to enjoy playing our website while sharing their experiences with their friends. We created this idea based off the nostalgia of our childood computer labs days ex: fire boy and water girl.

How to run: 
Becuase this is not our most recent version we would need a hotspot to remote connect to the raspberry pi in order to update it using this IP: **76.88.115.31:5000** . Currently, If you downloaded our repository, you would be able to run our website through an IDE such as IntellJ.

Home: Contains the goal and purpose of the website. Also contains how you navigate the website.

About Us: Greeting plus a little about us.

Games: Where all the games are going to be located

Website prototype: [Ideas](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eqZ7LM41xWljfpzlHo48bkBlsybnzl5qE66Ltlr5jT0/edit#slide=id.gea75123cf8_0_82)

Website progress: run code then go to [here](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

## **Sprint 5,6 week 5**
**Theme: Every Scrum Team needs to integrate "RGB Values with an Image" to their project.**

> Requirements
- [x] **Arch + Aidan** RGB Values with an Image, Frontend... how would you change to grey scale dynamically?  Look for Hack in code.

- [x] **Tyler + William + David** RGB Values with an Image, Backend... how would you write a message into image (Links to an external site.) and transport it to the Web?  Look at Pillow Image write in Tester.

- [x] **Arch + Aidan** RGB Values with an Image, New Development.  explore and implement a new possibility in manipulating images (Links to an external site.).

- [x] **Arch + Aidan** RGB Values with an Image, Backend... image files are really big, this would make a Programmer consider being efficiency in programming.  What are the calculations?  Could the image.py function "def image_data" more efficient?  There is a science to writing efficient algorithms called Big O notation (Links to an external site.). Write image_data function to be more efficient according to Big O notation.

- [x] **William + David + Tyler** Research/Study sheet/journal.  what is base2, base8, base16.  what is base64?   How is base64 different? what are some ideas from this research that you can use in your PBL project?  Add backlog items.

- ### **Complete TPT Activities**
- [x] Scrum/Pair activity.  Listen to OO's and TO's introduction.  Write about OOs' and TOs roles in your journal.  Brainstorm on how you think fellow student can help you in Test Prep.  Review idea with Scrum Team, then review again with Crossover team.  Each Scrum Team create summary and provide ideas to OO's.
  
- [x] Scrum/Pair activity and journal. Unit 3.1 work.   Follow instructions and guidance from OO's
  
- [x] Scrum/Pair activity and journal. Unit 3.2 work.   Follow instructions and guidance from OO's

> Prototyping and Research

- Team Designer/Coder pair.  Prototype layout.  Get your own STYLE, COLORS, FONTS; get your basic groove into your site.  Create these elements.  This should be consider CSS or <"style"> for your site.
- [x] [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp) can provide guidance on CSS..
- [x] Experiment with Two themes...  Try a couple of prototype experiments and get feedback from Crossover.


- Team Designer/Coder pair.  Create location for Mini-labs, you could rename this to something for your team (aka How-its-Made, Concepts, etc).  This can have research or early concepts from your team.   Additionally this section should have embeds to Brain Write, Wireframes, Greet, and TPT3.  Evidence of research or early design. Try3x3 or 4x4 design on page.
- [x] [Bootstrap Grid](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/) layout is a suggested technical option.


- Individual Coding.   Review and update you home pages again.  Make sure you have a wireframe that can be linked to from your home page that shows design.  Review embedding and design concept [here](https://padlet.com/jmortensen7/embedding)


- Individual Research.   [Learn about binary](https://apclassroom.collegeboard.org/103/home?unit=2)  (Links to an external site.)this week through TPT and TT.  Also, review related videos on CB and Harvard Video.  Update journal, be ready to work on Binary lab next week.
